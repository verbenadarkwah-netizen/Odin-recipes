    <p>Calamari is a popular appetizer made from squid, often served fried and crispy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g calamari rings</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce for dipping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Follow:</h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>Rinse the calamari rings under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, paprika, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Dredge the calamari rings in the flour mixture, ensuring they are well coated. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated calamari rings into the hot oil in batches. Fry for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the fried calamari from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the calamari hot with lemon wedges and marinara sauce for dipping if desired.</li>
